# RomanRoute

The goal is to build a **Roman route finder**... i.e. it shows you which roads you need to take to go from Roma to Mediolanum.

It's going to be written in **Rust**, because I never used such language and I want to learn a bit of it.

Initial features:

* It should tell all the available options (with a limit in the maximum number of roads, in order to avoid bizarre routes)
* It should tell a distance in km for every route (approximate is OK at the beginning)

Other desirable features:

* Tell a (very approximate) running distance using transport means of the time (foot, horse, oxen-pulled wagon, ...)
